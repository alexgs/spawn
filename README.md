# Spawn

Launch a script into a separate process with custom environment variables

## Usage

Define your custom environment variables in `<app-root>/config/config.json` using this format:

```json
{
    "data": {
        "NODE_ENV": "development"
    }
}
```

Then use `spawn` in the "scripts" section of your `package.json`, like so:

```json
{
    "scripts": {
        "start": "spawn nodemon ./scripts/launch-dev-server.js --exec babel-node",
        "test": "spawn mocha"
    }
}
```

## Prior Art

This script is derived from a similar script. I would like to credit the original author(s), but I have lost all references to the original! (It may be a script that is generated by the Express app generator.)
